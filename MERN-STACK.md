### Node.js :
Node.js is  JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of  browser. JavaScript is used for client side scripting, and  scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client side by  JavaScript engine in the users web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is send to the user web browser. Node.js represents JavaScript everywhere , unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side & client side scripts.
